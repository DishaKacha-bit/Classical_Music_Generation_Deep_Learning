In the realm of musical creation, the fusion of art and technology has opened doors to innovative approaches for generating compositions. 
This project delves into the fascinating domain of using Neural Network models to craft classical music—a harmonious blend of tradition and innovation. 
Motivated by my passion for music and driven by the desire to unravel the intricacies of classical compositions, I embarked on a journey to explore the predictability of musical patterns inherent in this genre. 
My endeavor was fueled by the aspiration to push the boundaries of music generation and explore the potential of Neural Network models in creating authentic classical compositions. 
With the aid of advanced techniques and algorithms, I sought to craft pieces that resonate with the rich legacy of classical music, seamlessly blending tradition with contemporary methodologies. 
For this endeavor, I leveraged a comprehensive dataset comprising classical music compositions in the MIDI format. MIDI files, renowned for their versatility and expressive capabilities, served as the cornerstone of my project, providing a diverse array of musical motifs and arrangements to fuel my exploration. 
Central to my approach was the utilization of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models—a cutting-edge neural network architecture renowned for its prowess in sequence modeling and generation. 
By harnessing the power of LSTM, I aimed to unravel the underlying structures and patterns inherent in classical music, paving the way for the creation of compositions that captivate the imagination and evoke emotions.
